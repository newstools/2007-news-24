Over 15 000 KZN taxi operators have been affected by the recapitalisation process. The court ruled on November 5 that Transport Minister Jeff Radebe must determine a new date for the conversion of permits into operating licences. Mhlongo said the date was inappropriate, misguided and misinformed. The court ruled that the minister must consider the capacity of his administration to carry out the work involved. Radebe was ordered to pay the legal costs. mthobisi@witness.co.za
