Philip de BruinHis wife also alleged yesterday that Dalton slept with several of my friends and people who were not known to me , since their wedding in January 2003.Andrea Dalton filed an affidavit for an urgent court order to restrict Dalton from approaching any closer to her than 500 metres, among other things. The interdict was refused because Dalton had not been informed of it before it was heard in court. Andrea said in the affidavit on Friday that James tried to drown her while she lay in the bath in their house in the posh Silverlakes suburb east of Pretoria on that day, after attempting to strangle her. The reason, according to her, was that she had refused to take him to a golf day because he was intoxicated and reeked of liquor .She said Dalton had assaulted her on several occasions during the course of their marriage, but claimed she did not file a complaint sooner because she feared for her life. In other developments, Dalton cancelled talks between himself, his attorney Oeloff de Meyer and Andrea's attorney, Barry Kotze, because he felt deeply hurt by the publicity relating to Friday's incident, Kotze said on inquiry yesterday. Andrea was not included in the talks because she is under protection in a place of safety. She spoke briefly to Beeld yesterday and said there is no chance of reconciliation between her and Dalton, and that she is filing for divorce.She confirmed that she has laid a charge of serious assault against him at Boskop Police Station.Kotze also confirmed that Dalton can expect another two subpoenas this week, one suing him for divorce and the other a semi-urgent application to prevent him from physically approaching or making contact with his wife. De Meyer said he has strictly forbidden Dalton to talk about the allegations against him, because I want to resolve this dispute myself .He said Dalton still denies all allegations of violence as contained in Friday's affidavit.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
